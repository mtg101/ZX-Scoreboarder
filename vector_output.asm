;
; 02/07/2012:	Added Pixel_Address_Down and Pixel_Address_Up routines
; 04/07/2012:	Moved Clear_Screen to Screen_Buffer
; 08/02/2010:	Added Print_BC
;		Moved Clear_Screen into here (originally in screen_buffer.z80)
;		All output routines refactored to use HL for screen address
;		Added Fill_Attr routine
;


; Get screen address
; B = Y pixel position
; C = X pixel position
; Returns address in HL and pixel position within character in A
;
Get_Pixel_Address:	LD A,B				; Calculate Y2,Y1,Y0
			AND %00000111			; Mask out unwanted bits
			OR %01000000			; Set base address of screen
			LD H,A				; Store in H
			LD A,B				; Calculate Y7,Y6
			RRA				; Shift to position
			RRA
			RRA
			AND %00011000			; Mask out unwanted bits
			OR H				; OR with Y2,Y1,Y0
			LD H,A				; Store in H
			LD A,B				; Calculate Y5,Y4,Y3
			RLA				; Shift to position
			RLA
			AND %11100000			; Mask out unwanted bits
			LD L,A				; Store in L
			LD A,C				; Calculate X4,X3,X2,X1,X0
			RRA				; Shift into position
			RRA
			RRA
			AND %00011111			; Mask out unwanted bits
			OR L				; OR with Y5,Y4,Y3
			LD L,A				; Store in L
			LD A,C
			AND 7
			RET

; Move HL down one pixel line
;
Pixel_Address_Down:	
			INC H				; Go down onto the next pixel line
			LD A,H				; Check if we have gone onto next character boundary
			AND 7
			RET NZ				; No, so skip the next bit
			LD A,L				; Go onto the next character line
			ADD A,32
			LD L,A
			RET C				; Check if we have gone onto next third of screen
			LD A,H				; Yes, so go onto next third
			SUB 8
			LD H,A
			RET
